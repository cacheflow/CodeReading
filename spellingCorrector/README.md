This is [Brian Adkins](http://blog.lojic.com/2008/09/04/how-to-write-a-spelling-corrector-in-ruby/) code for a spelling corrector in Ruby inspired by Peter Norving's post on creating the same thing in [21 lines](http://www.norvig.com/spell-correct.html) of Python code. 

I'm going to study it later and see if I can figure out what's going on.
